#Write a program to determine the length of a ladder required to reach a
#given height when leaned against a house. The height and angle of the
#ladder are given as inputs. To compute length use:
#length = height / sin(angle)
#Note: The angle must be in radians. Prompt for an angle in degrees and
#use this formula to convert:
#radians = pi/180 * degrees

import math

def main():
    height, degrees = eval(input("Enter height + degrees separated by a comma: "))
    radians = math.pi / 180 * degrees
    length = height / math.sin(radians)
    print("Length of ladder required is: ", length)

main()
